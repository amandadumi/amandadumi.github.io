      <description>The short of it: Details the theory and resources that resulting from an Ising model project developed for a graduate Statistical mechanics course at the University of Pittsburgh. The main assignment is provided by a Jupyter notebook in which a framework to the Monte Carlo Modeling of the 2-D Ising Model is given and students are walked through developing the missing pieces. A complimentary website has smaller sections which get students accustomed to Python, installing necessary software, and working with Jupyter notebooks.</description>

      <description>The short of it: Chemreps is a python package which aims to create molecular representation as presented in the literature that can be used to generate machine learning models.
Background Machine learning has become a highly viable tool within the quantum chemistry field. The hopes are that one can learn predict the surface of a chemical space while avoiding the need to calculate each and every molecule with a high-scaling method such as couple-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)).</description>

      <description>Although I intended to keep this a purely computational chemistry related blog, sometimes you do some fun things that can be shared. I was feeling a little stressed and decided I wanted to try my hand at cooking, which is usually a disaster. However, the most stressful part was finding a recipe. So instead of living in the stone age and writing the recipes down on notecards that inevitably get ingredients spilled on them and destroyed, I turned to Python.</description>
