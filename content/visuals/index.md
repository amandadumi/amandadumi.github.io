Occasionally, I like to play around with visualization tools for chemistry. Hoping to get better with it, but here are some things I've made so far.

## Inkscape

{{< img_resize "*water4*" "A small abstract rendering of (water)4. nonvalence correlation-bound anion" >}}


## Blender
{{< img_resize "*base*" "An illustrative rendering of a silyl ketene monomer, where the cubes labelled R can be replaced with any functional group" >}}
{{< img_resize "*trimer_*" "A silyl ketene trimer" >}}
