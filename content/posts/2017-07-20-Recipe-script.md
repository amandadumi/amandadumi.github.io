Although I intended to keep this a purely computational chemistry related blog, sometimes you do some fun things that can be shared. I was feeling a little stressed and decided I wanted to try my hand at cooking, which is usually a disaster. However, the most stressful part was finding a recipe. So instead of living in the stone age and writing the recipes down on notecards that inevitably get ingredients spilled on them and destroyed, I turned to Python. I categorize the recipes into three dictionaries: entrees, breakfast, dessert. From there I store the recipe URL under a second key in the nested dictionary.

The script is basically a glorified bookmarks bar, i.e. it's very simple and pretty dumb, but also maybe useful to someone.
