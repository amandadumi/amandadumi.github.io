### The short of it:
Chemreps is a python package which aims to create molecular representation as presented in the literature that can be used to generate machine learning models.

### Background 
Machine learning has become a highly viable tool within the quantum chemistry field. 
The hopes are that one can learn predict the surface of a chemical space while avoiding the need to calculate each and every molecule with a high-scaling method such as couple-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)).
The performance of the machine learning model is dependent on the type of fittin approach used, Kernel ridge regression or SVR for example, and the form of the data. 
For chemistry, one needs to capture relevant structure information. 
However, there is no agreed upon singular approach for a descriptor. 
This has lead to many different descriptors entering the arena.
